## 🚀 DEPLOY YOUR FRONTEND NOW

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended - Works Better)

```powershell
cd packages/frontend
netlify deploy --prod
```

**Steps:**
1. It will ask you to authenticate → Follow the browser prompt
2. "Create & configure a new site" → Press **Enter**
3. "Team" → Select your team
4. "Site name" → Type **monadgotchi** (or leave blank for random)
5. "Publish directory" → Type **dist**

**You'll get:**
```
✅ Live URL: https://monadgotchi.netlify.app
```

### Option 2: Try Vercel Again

```powershell
cd packages/frontend
vercel --prod
```

If it fails again, stick with Netlify!

### Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages

```powershell
cd packages/frontend
npm install -g gh-pages
npm run build
npx gh-pages -d dist
```

## 📱 WHAT USERS CAN DO

Once deployed, users can:

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Open your dApp URL
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Approve MetaMask

2. **Switch to Monad Testnet**
   - Network Name: Monad Testnet
   - RPC URL: https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
   - Chain ID: 10143
   - Currency: MON

3. **Mint a Pet**
   - Click "Mint Your First Pet"
   - Approve transaction
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Pet appears!

4. **Feed the Pet**
   - Click "Feed Pet"
   - Approve transaction
   - Hunger resets to 0

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Temporary)

### Without Envio Indexer:
- ❌ Real-time hunger updates (won't auto-refresh)
- ❌ Transaction history display
- ❌ Agent can't auto-feed (needs indexer to find hungry pets)

### What Still Works:
- ✅ Minting pets
- ✅ Manual feeding
- ✅ All contract interactions
- ✅ Wallet connection
- ✅ Pet display

---

## 🔧 TO ENABLE FULL FUNCTIONALITY

### Deploy Envio from Linux/Mac:

```bash
# On a Linux/Mac machine or VM
cd envio
envio codegen
envio deploy
```

**Then:**
1. Copy the GraphQL endpoint URL
2. Update `.env`:
   ```
   ENVIO_ENDPOINT=https://indexer.envio.dev/YOUR_ID/graphql
   ```
3. Start the agent:
   ```powershell
   cd packages/agent
   npm start
   ```
4. Redeploy frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd packages/frontend
   npm run build
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Netlify Deploy Fails
```powershell
# Try manual deploy
cd packages/frontend
npm run build
# Then drag the dist/ folder to netlify.com
```

### MetaMask Can't Connect
- Make sure Monad testnet is added
- Chain ID must be 10143
- RPC: https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz

### Contract Not Found
- Verify you're on Monad testnet
- Check contract address is correct
- Ensure you have testnet MON
